review
I loved the movie. It was fantastic and thrilling.
The movie was terrible. I hated every moment of it.
"It was okay. Not great, but not bad either."
A wonderful performance by the lead actor!
Poor script and bad direction ruined the film.
An absolute masterpiece. Brilliant direction and story.
Awful. Complete waste of time.
Just average. Some parts were enjoyable.
A beautiful and touching film. Highly recommend it.
The worst movie Iâ€™ve seen this year.
